ESP8266 / ESP32 Projekte for Home Assistant
This is a collection of my projects for the ESP8266 and ESP 32 in connection with the smart home with home assistant that I use.

I take no responsibility for the function of the projects. 
These modules, some of which I built myself, work in my smart home environment.
